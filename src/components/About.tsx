    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Boris Pavel, an enthusiastic self-taught software developer with a
      passion for automation and software programming in general. While I haven't held a
      professional job yet, I've already built several projects using technologies
      like Flask and React.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of coding, I enjoy traveling and spending quality time with friends.
      I approach both life and software development with a stoic mindset and focusing
      on growth, resilience, and continuous learning.
